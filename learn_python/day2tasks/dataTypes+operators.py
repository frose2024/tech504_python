# What is the different btwn an operator and an operand? Operators manipulate operands.
x = 5

#add
david = x + y

#subtract
gooses = x - y

#multiply
camels = x * x
print(camels)

#divide
biblical = camels / gooses
print(biblical)

#modulus - finding the remainder of the division btwn two numbers
morbinTime = 12 % 6
# if you divide 12 by 6 you get 2, with nothing left over.
print(morbinTime)
morbinTime = 12 % 5
# No longer a perfect division. 5 goes into 12 twice, making 10, with 2 left over (12 - 10 = 2)
