## A slightly smaller heading

### Even smaller 

Plain text 
- Tables of contents are generated from the headings. 

*italics can be done with stars*

_underscores are also a way to do italics_

**bold is done with double stars**

__or with double underscores__

> If you want it to look like a pretty little quote use an angle bracket >
>> This allows you to do a quote in a quote, good way to name the author

### Lists can be done with asterixes
* Like this 
- Or it can be done with hyphens
  - If you indent the list you can make sub lists. 
    - Even more sub. 

### How do we do a numbered list?
1.  Look at this it's a numbered list. 
2.  Omg even more lists.


### Images
How we add an image to a markdown document? It more or less does it for you.

### Links
How do we add links to markdown? A lot like you'd add the picture. First part is the name of the link/what is actually displayed, second part is the link.

### Formatting Code
This is how you print hello to the screen in python : `print(hello)`
Code blocks can be done in a similar way using three backticks :
```python
Markdown is uber duper clever because you can specify the code language, and then it will colour the syntax for you
```


### HTML
You can use HTML to better control the formatting of a document.

You can't see this but I've used the line break HTML syntax for force space. 


### Task List
* [ ] Makes you a delightful little check list. Unticked. 
* [x] If you want to make a ticked task box, need to use an x

### Tables
Truthfully, I do not enjoy constructing tables in Markdown. It's a bit of a faff.
